Skeleton file structure for creating command grammars based on
[Breathe](https://github.com/mrob95/Breathe) and [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly).

## Getting started
* Use `my_commands/core/keys.py` as a template to create new command sets
    in the `core`, `apps`, and `languages` folders.
* When you create new files, register them in `_main.py` so that they will be loaded on start up.
